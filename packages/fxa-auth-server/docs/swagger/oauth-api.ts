      Authorize a new OAuth client connection to the user's account, returning a short-lived authentication code that the client can exchange for access tokens at the OAuth token endpoint.

      This route behaves like the oauth-server /authorization endpoint except that it is authenticated directly with a sessionToken rather than with a BrowserID assertion.

      Grant new OAuth tokens for use by a connected client, using one of the following grant types:
        - \`grant_type=authorization_code\`: A single-use code obtained via OAuth redirect flow.
        - \`grant_type=refresh_token\`: A refresh token issued by a previous call to this endpoint.
        - \`grant_type=fxa-credentials\`: Directly grant tokens using an FxA sessionToken.

      This is the "token endpoint" as defined in RFC6749, and behaves like the oauth-server /token endpoint except that the \`fxa-credentials\` grant can be authenticated directly with a sessionToken rather than with a BrowserID assertion.
