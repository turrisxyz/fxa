      Creates a user account. The client provides the email address with which this account will be associated and a stretched password. Stretching is detailed on the [**onepw**](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/wiki/onepw-protocol#creating-the-account) wiki page.

      This endpoint may send a verification email to the user. Callers may optionally provide the \`service\` parameter to indicate which service they are acting on behalf of. This is an opaque alphanumeric token that will be embedded in the verification link as a query parameter.

      Creating an account also logs in. The response contains a \`sessionToken\` and, optionally, a \`keyFetchToken\` if the url has a query parameter of \`keys=true\`.

      Get the email and locale of a user.

      If an OAuth bearer token is used, the values returned depend on the scopes that the token is authorized for:
        - \`email\` requires \`profile:email\` scope.
        - \`locale\` requires \`profile:locale\` scope.
        - \`authenticationMethods\` and \`authenticatorAssuranceLevel\` require \`profile:amr\` scope.

      The \`profile\` scope includes all the above sub-scopes.

      Get the base-16 bundle of encrypted \`kA|wrapKb\`. The return value must be decrypted with a key derived from \`keyFetchToken\`, then \`wrapKb\` must be further decrypted with a key derived from the user's password.

      Since \`keyFetchToken\` is single-use, this can only be done once per session. Note that \`keyFetchToken\` is consumed regardless of whether the request succeeds or fails.

      This request will fail unless the account's email address and current session has been verified.
